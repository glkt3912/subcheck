# Implementation Plan: SubCheck Subscription Diagnostic Service

**Branch**: `001-subcheck-mvp` | **Date**: 2025-10-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-subcheck-mvp/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

SubCheck is a client-side web application that helps Japanese users analyze their subscription service usage patterns and identify wasteful spending. The application provides a 4-step diagnostic process (service selection, usage frequency input, calculation, results visualization) with social sharing capabilities. All data processing occurs locally with no server dependencies, targeting 20-40 age demographic with mobile-first responsive design.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with Next.js 14+ (existing project stack)  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18+, Next.js App Router, Chart.js/Recharts (visualization), Tailwind CSS (styling)  
**Storage**: Browser LocalStorage only (no backend/database)  
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library (performance and modern Next.js integration)  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)  
**Project Type**: Web application - single-page app with multiple screens  
**Performance Goals**: <3s initial load, <2s result calculation, 90% mobile completion rate  
**Constraints**: Client-side only, no external APIs, responsive design required  
**Scale/Scope**: MVP targeting individual users, ~5 main screens, minimal complexity

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Constitution template not yet customized, no violations to check. 

**Post-Phase 1 Re-evaluation**: ✅ PASS - Design maintains simplicity with client-side only architecture, no complex patterns introduced, follows Next.js conventions.

**Structure Decision**: Next.js App Router structure selected to match existing project setup. Client-side architecture with clear separation between UI components, business logic (calculations), data management (LocalStorage), and type definitions. No backend components needed due to local-only processing requirement.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
